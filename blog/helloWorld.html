            <div id="post__content">
                <p>Welcome to our brand new website. We're Banana Bonanza, a group of friends that enjoy making games together. So far, we've only participated in a few game jams, but we've been tossing around ideas for bigger and better projects to work on without strict time restrictions. I myself have a couple solo projects that I hope to one day share under the BB umbrella. As my Itch.io bio reads, "I'm focused on game jams with friends, but I enjoy saying that I'll 'one day' make a full game'.</p>
                <p>Under "Jams", you can find all of the games we've created together during game jams. I can't say they're award winners, but most of them at least have a unique central idea. I wouldn't say we're the best under the time crunch of a game jam, so we tend to get an idea and stick with it, regardless of whether it's good or not. But that's the whole point of game jamsâ€”to experiment and have fun!</p>
                <p>Any upcoming (or maybe, by the time you're reading this, released) games can be found on the, you guessed it, "Games" page. Not much can be said about this, really. It's pretty self-explanatory...</p>
                <p>I've added a blog to the site to act as my own dumping ground for whatever cool discoveries I want to share throughout my game development ventures. I'm currently the only one of us with access to the website and its files, so for now it's just me, PurpleRTA. I'm hoping this hostile takeover of the website will lead to my owning the company if we ever get that far.</p>
                <p>Finally, get to know us a little on the "About" page. You can also find us on social media, where you can get in contact with us if you have any further inquiries.</p>
